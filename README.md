FoxBnb is a travel planning application that allows you to choose a house destination, book the dates of your stay via an interactive calendar, and even chat with the owners of the house you are planning to
stay at (thanks to the implementation of SignalR) ! It goes in pair with the Foxbnb API that you can find in my repositories.


## Usage

You can see that there are seed users already to help you use the app without having to register with your actual email address.
You can log in as a customer (credentials: Email:youssef@foxbnb.com Password:Foxbnb123!) or as an owner (credentials: Email: estelle@foxbnb.com Password:Foxbnb123!).
As a customer you can check out the houses, pick one, book some days to stay and chat with the owner of the house to get more details. Once a user has booked a period in 
the MatDatePicker calendar, it is impossible to bookm the same dates as they appear blurred and unselectable.
